A native anonymous chat app for Android, much like Omegle but text-based (think WhatsApp or Telegram). The core idea is that by choosing from a list of topics, you can then link up with another person that matches your topics automatically and start chatting. All without requiring you to register to the app, the mechanisms of which utilizes Firebase's features, mainly Functions in the [backend-side](https://github.com/ReQuill/BlabbleBackend) (my area of focus). This was part of a college group-assignment in Mobile Programming course which implements project-based learning.
