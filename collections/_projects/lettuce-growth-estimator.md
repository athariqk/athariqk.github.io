A mobile-first computer vision solution for enabling non-destructive method of estimating lettuce plant growth by leveraging a lightweight deep learning model. The model achieved satisfactory results, with 70% in Average Precision, over 90% in Coefficient of Determination, and less than 600 ms of inference time. Deployable to Android via ExecuTorch.

This was made for my undergraduate thesis.
